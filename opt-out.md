# Opt-out Statement
I decided not to complete the tasks in Step 3 Option 2 for this assignment.

The parts that feel overwhelming to me right now is setting up automated testing and CI because I just don't have much experience with doing that in Github.

I plan to build more confidence in those areas by practicing using pytest in my personal projects and looking up tutorials on how to use CI tools.
